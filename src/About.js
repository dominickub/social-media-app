### Introduction

This app is built to connect all the superheroes who might need support whether it be on the fighting scene or just emotional support. Maybe they just want to hangout and this is the app for needs!

### UI Features


### Functionalities

The app consists of a few functionalities and data. We start off with the json file where we seed our database with different hero information and posts that our main character provides whenever he feels like it. We “fetch” our data from our local computer which mimics an api server and converts the response to json to be understandable to React. Essentially our functionalities are the ability to “GET”, “POST” and “DELETE”.

### Result Resource

This app allows you to create a post or delete one within the profile of Batman. In our friends list you can add a new one and all this information that is added or removed will be reflected within the database.
